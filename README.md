This code is used for resampling the data and creating a correlation matrix cross-plot in RStudio.

Instructions:

Import setwd to read the data in the specified folder.
Install raster packages, to read raster file formats.
Run the raster library.

Read the raster files with the correct spelling given in the file folder.
Resample the variables by specifying any one of the constant variables in order to have the same extent, cell size, no. of rows and columns for all the variables in one standard.

Stack all the variables to plot them. Once run, all the variables will be individually plotted in the Plots window of RStudio.
Run the correlation plot, to find the relationship of each variable with one another, to finalize the variables according to the study.
   If the correlation plot isn't displayed install graphic packages. One can also update the graphics from the global options in the toolbar.

Export the variable in any desired format by mentioning the extension.
   If the export isn't working, run the raster package once again.

  Always use frontslash(/) for the paths in the directory. #Note
