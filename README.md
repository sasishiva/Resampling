This code is basically used for resampling the data and create a correlation matrix cross-plot in RStudio.

Instructions:

Import setwd to read the data in the specified folder.
Install raster packages, to read raster file formats.
Run the raster library.

Read the raster files with the correct spelling given in the file folder.
Resample the varibales by specifiying any one of the constant varibale in order to have the same extent, cell size, no. of rows and columns for all the varibales in one standard.

Stack all the varibale to plot them. Once runned, all the varibales will be individally plotted in the Plots window of RStudio.
Run the correlation plot, in order to find the the relationship of each varible with one another, in order to finalise the varibles according to the study.
   If the correlation plot isn't displayed install graphic packages. One can also update the graphics from the global options in the toolbar.

Export the variable in any desired format by mentioning the extension.
   If the export isnt working, run the raster package once again.

  Always use frontslash(/) for the paths int he directory. #Note
